## General Information
- Considering the demographic (all ages) simplicity was key as the websites purpose is to present key information about the gym for users who showed interest. Avoiding unnecessary bulk or navigation.
- The client uses social media ( Facebook and Instagram ) for exposure as the location is Peebles ( Scottish Borders ) so the gym information is passed down by word of mouth. Having a website the client could plug into their social media would allow all information in one concise area.
- I had suggested creating a back-end for booking time slots as they are currently using [GymSync](https://www.gymsync.co.uk/) but it was deemed unnecessary as members have been using GymSync for sometime and the transition would be a hinderance (still possible at a later date).
- Another reason the back-end disregarded was that the town is fairly small and he mostly communicates via email and has a face to face with new member to handover their key and give them a run down of the gym. Making it an unnecessary change for what works for the client.
- On starting this project I stated broadening my understanding of the Web Design / UX landscape, getting in the mind of the user.
